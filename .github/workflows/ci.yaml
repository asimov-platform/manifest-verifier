# WARNING! PLEASE READ BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES:
#
# This workflow is triggered on `pull_request_target` event,
# which makes it highly prone to security issues,
# as in this case we are executing untrusted, user-provided,
# potentially malicious code from pull requests in an environment
# that might contain overly permissive tokens or exposed secrets,
# if not implemented properly.
#
# Please only modify this file if you know what you're doing.
